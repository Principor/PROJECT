# Final Year Project

The goal of this project is compare reinforcement learning methods in their ability to train an adaptive autonomous
driving agent. 

To run this code requires a virtual environment. This can be set up using <code>conda env create -f environment.yml
</code>

<ul>
  <li>To train an agent, run "train.py"</li>
  <li>To test an agent, run "test.py"</li>
  <li>To analyse telemetry from the car, run "analyse_telemetry.py"</li>
  <li>To view/edit tracks, run "track_editor.py"</li>
</ul>

Scores from training are saved to the summaries directory, and can viewed using tensorboard
