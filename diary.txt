Created basic "vanilla" policy gradient that learns successfully.
Biggest issue encountered was setting up and maintaining version control for conda virtual environment.

2022/10/23
Finally implemented PPO loss.
Struggled all week with getting good performance - discovered problem was softmax dim for actor

2022/10/27
Experimented with GAE, adding entropy to loss, and decaying parameters, without success.
Moving on to creating custom racing environment

2022/10/30
Installed pybullet physics engine
Implemented initial car physics

2022/11/03
Implemented tire and suspension dynamics

2022/11/06
Finished basic car behaviour

2022/11/15
Discovered that ignoring "truncated" output was slowing performance dramatically and leading to worse training.

2022/11/17
Finally finished complete implementation of PPO.

2022/11/21
Agent can successfully drive to waypoints

2022/11/29
Basic "constant" racing environment is complete

2023/01/15
Started making Recurrent Neural Network
