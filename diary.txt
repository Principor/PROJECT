Created basic "vanilla" policy gradient that learns successfully.
Biggest issue encountered was setting up and maintaining version control for conda virtual environment.

Finally implemented PPO loss.
Struggled all week with getting good performance - discovered problem was softmax dim for actor

Experimented with GAE, adding entropy to loss, and decaying parameters, without success.
Moving on to creating custom racing environment

Discovered that ignoring "truncated" output was slowing performance dramatically and leading to worse training.
